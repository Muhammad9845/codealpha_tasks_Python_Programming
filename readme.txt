📚 CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship

Brief One Line Summary

```A comprehensive collection of Python projects demonstrating game development, financial applications, and AI chatbots through practical programming tasks.

🧠 Overview

```This repository contains my Python programming internship tasks completed for CodeAlpha, showcasing three major projects:

```1:Hangman Game – A classic word-guessing game with ASCII art

```2:Stock Portfolio Tracker – Financial investment calculator and manager

```3:Basic Chatbot – Rule-based conversational AI with multiple response patterns

   It serves as a demonstration of Python programming skills and can be used as a learning resource for beginners in Python development.

💡 Problem Statement
The internship focuses on building practical Python applications that solve real-world problems through:

```Interactive game development for entertainment and learning

```Financial portfolio management for investment tracking

```Conversational AI for basic customer service applications

```Demonstrating fundamental programming concepts in action

⚙️ Methods

Task 1: Hangman Game
   Implemented using Object-Oriented Programming with a dedicated HangmanGame class

   Used random module for word selection from predefined list

   Incorporated ASCII art for visual hangman representation

   Added input validation and error handling for robust user experience

File: Task-1-hangman_game/hangman_game.py
Key Features: 5 predefined words, 6 guess limit, play-again functionality

Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
   Created console-based financial application with hardcoded stock prices

   Implemented portfolio calculation and allocation percentages

   Added file export functionality for portfolio reports

   Included comprehensive input validation and error handling

File: Task-2-stock_portfolio_tracker/stock_portfolio.py

Task 4: Basic Chatbot
   Built rule-based conversational AI with predefined response patterns

   Used pattern matching and random response selection for variety

   Implemented "typing" effect simulation for natural conversation flow

   Added help system and multiple conversation categories

File: Task-4-basic_chatbot/chatbot.py
Response Categories: Greetings, Feelings, Information, Time/Date, Goodbyes

🔍 Key Insights
```Object-Oriented Programming significantly improves code organization and reusability

```Input validation is crucial for creating robust user-facing applications

```Modular code structure allows for easy maintenance and feature additions

```Python's standard libraries provide powerful tools for diverse application types

```Error handling enhances user experience and prevents application crashes
